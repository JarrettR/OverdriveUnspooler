Tampermonkey script to listen to your loans offline

## Usage

- Install Tampermonkey (some complications exist on Chrome(why are you still using Chrome?))
- Click on the "Listen Now in Browser" button
- There's a new down-arrow button on top left. Click it
- It'll take a minute of nothing appearing to happen. Just be patient. Then all of the files will simultaneously download


## Caveats

Works For Me (tm).

Only tested on Linux / Firefox.


Compatibility and QoL fixes are welcome, but I wrote this script for me, for me to listen to my own loans offline, so I will be devoting minimal attention to it while it still works.
